This project demonstrates an experimental workflow of controlling Non-Player Characters (NPC) in Unreal Engine 5 using natural language voice commands. As for the scope of this project, there are several key components to be integrated, such as 
1. Fully Functional VoIP Communication System 
2. Speech-To-Text (STT) Recognition System - OpenAI Whisper
3. Behaviour Classification AI model (Natural Language Understanding model)
4. Unreal AI system for NPC behaviour (HTN/Behaviour Tree)
